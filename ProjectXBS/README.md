# Project XBS
###  What is XBS?
  > XBS is a compiled programming language, which is then ran in lower-level code with artifacts for reference.
  > XBS will be written in javascript first, then ported to other languages when necessary.
### What is the purpose of XBS?
  > The purpose of XBS is to create a flexible, easy-to-use programming language with similarities between multiple programming languages.
  > A side purpose for XBS is to be a fun and challenging project to work on, which will help expand my knowledge on creating programming languages.
### What will XBS be used for?
  > XBS could be used mainly for *games*, *backend systems*, or *server-sided* code.
  > I don't restrict what you can do with XBS; push the limits if you want.
### Challenges to overcome
  > * The main challenge that I face is giving up, something that isn't good but I've done it before on things similar to this. I see hope for XBS, as I will allow myself to scrap parts of my code that are not good for workflow and are not easy to use/edit.
  > * I will have to overcome many difficult tasks, like creating a succesful *parser*. There will be several generations of steps in creating this programming languages.
### Bridge Documentation
  > * There are no *bridge docs* yet, the programming language is not **finished**
